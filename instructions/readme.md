Welcome to the BigSpring Case-Study! 

This project is designed to serve as a representative model of the end-to-end engineering process that we follow at BigSpring. 

The project has the following phases:

1. You receive access to this repository, which contains this README and a [specification document](spec.md) that describes the project.
2. We meet for 30m - 45m to discuss the specification document and resolve any questions.
3. You spend a few hours independently working on code that aims to fulfill the specification document. This can be done either the day of your onsite interview or before, depending on logistics and time constraints.
4. We meet for 1.5h to discuss the code you've written in an open-ended way: particular implementation choices you made, changing requirements, etc.

Goals of this project:

1. We see how you work within a representative environment on representative problems.
2. We see how you think and write code.

Non-goals of this project:

1. We do not expect code that fulfills all aspects of the spec! Please do not spend more than a day of your time on this. The intent is to understand how you think about problems and write code, not whether you can implement a spec end to end in limited time.
2. We do not expect a production-ready code base. Please feel free to "cut corners" where appropriate: data persistence, infrastructure, and polished front-end design are all areas that could be ignored (or, focused on, if that's your thing!).

Reach out to arun@bigspring.io with any questions you have.
